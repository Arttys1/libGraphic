# libGraphic
This is a little 3D graphic library. It's a personal project where i can learn openGL. Feel free to use it, modify it or tell me what i should improve in it :D

Curently, the library can render simple shape like triangle, rectangle or cube and apply color and texture on it.
You can apply transformation like rotation or translation on the shapes.

things to do :

- make texture shareable with severals shapes
- add lights options
- make the lib portable on linux
- and many others :D
