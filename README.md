# libGraphic
This is a little 3D graphic library. It's a personal project where i can learn openGL. Feel free to use it, modify it or tell me what i should improve in it :D

Curently, the library can render simple shape like triangle, rectangle or cube and apply color and texture on it.
The texture are shareable to improve performance.
You can apply transformation like rotation or translation on the shapes.
You can also put different lighting to the scene like point light, directional light or spot light. 
The library use Phong lighting system.

things to do :

- add model rendering
- make the lib portable on linux
- and many others :D
